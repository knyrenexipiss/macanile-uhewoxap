Overview
From bestselling cookbook author Julia Turshen comes an original, inspired, and interactive approach to cooking that takes the guesswork out of everyday meals.
 
 Julia Turshen is a home cookâ€™s best friend. Known for her simple, no-frills, yet utterly satisfying recipesâ€”as well as her authentic, relatable, problem-solving approachâ€”hers are the cookbooks we all turn to when we want to know what else we can make with some ground turkey, or if we can pull off dessert with a few basic pantry ingredients. In essence, we look to Julia when we want to know What Goes with What: to understand how we can transform the seemingly boring contents of our fridge into an exciting meal. Now, in her latest book, Julia offers readers a new way to think about cooking, one that focuses on mastering the alchemy of a mealâ€”and then offers endless iterations. Organized into six sections (salads and sandwiches; soups, stews and braises; rice, more grains, and pasta; vegetables; mains; and baked goods), Julia arms readers with 20 charts and 100 recipes that teach them how to build a successful dish, while making ample room for creativity and personal preference. For readers of tried and true cookbooks like Melissa Clarkâ€™s Dinner and Deb Perelmanâ€™s Smitten Kitchen series, as well as fans of Molly Baz and Alison Romanâ€™s breezy yet craveable recipes, What Goes with What will become an instant classic and find its place as a foundational cookbook for a new generation of home cooks.
