Overview
From USA Today bestselling author Rachel Hanna, Happy Harbor is a heartfelt, hometown romance perfect for fans of Debbie Macomber and Susan Mallery. Josie Campbell has spent her entire adult life distancing herself from her childhood in the small Southern town of Happy Harbor. Growing up with an alcoholic mother who was either absent or scandalizing the town with her antics, all Josie ever wanted was to escape to somewhere no one knew her as Dianeâ€™s daughter. Now, she finally has it allâ€”a great job, a condo in one of Atlantaâ€™s most desirable areas, a successful fiancÃ©, and her teenage daughter, Kendra, enrolled at a top-rated school. But when that life falls apart, and her beloved nana dies, Josie is forced to return to the one place she never wanted to visit again. Soon, she finds herself stepping into Nanaâ€™s shoes in Happy Harbor: running her quaint restaurant, living in their familyâ€™s historic home, and bumping into Walker Jacksonâ€”the disturbingly handsome man who lives in the guest houseâ€”on a near daily basis. All of which sounds idyllic, if it werenâ€™t for the painful memories lurking around every corner. Still, the place seems to be good for Kendra, who begs to stay, and Josie is inclined to at least make an attempt at a new life in this old town. That is, until her mother turns up. Diane insists sheâ€™s truly sober now and wants just one more chance. Nanaâ€™s last wish was for the two of them to reconcile, and sheâ€™s even arranged things to help make that happen. But with a lifetime of painful experiences that have taught her not to trust this woman, can Josie truly bring herself to forgive Diane?
