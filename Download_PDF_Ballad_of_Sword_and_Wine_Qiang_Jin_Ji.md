The fan-favorite danmei/Boysâ€™ Love novel series originally released in Chinese!
 
 In this historical tale of war and political intrigue, an intense relationship burns between the son of an infamous traitor and the vengeful nobleman who despises him...at first.
 
 Shen Zechuan is the eighth son of the traitorous Prince of Jianxing, a man who doomed his cities and people to destruction at the hands of the foreign enemy. As the only surviving member of his reviled line, Shen Zechuan is dragged to the capital in chains. He bears the hatred of the nation, but no one&amp;#039;s hate burns hotter than that of Xiao Chiye, the youngest son of the powerful Prince of Libei.
 
 Xiao Chiye would love nothing more than to see Shen Zechuan deadâ€”but against all odds, he clings to life. Rather than succumb to his family&amp;#039;s disgrace, he becomes a thorn in Xiao Chiye&amp;#039;s side, clawing his way into the cutthroat political world of the capital. Yet as these two bitter enemies beat against the bonds of their fate, they find themselves kindred spirits, unlikely allies...and perhaps something more.
 
 This Chinese historical fiction tale built around the desire between two men (danmei) has attracted fans from around the world and inspired a comic and an audio drama. The Seven Seas English-language edition includes exclusive new covers and interior illustrations.
