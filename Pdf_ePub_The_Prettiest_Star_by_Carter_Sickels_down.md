Small-town Appalachia doesn&amp;#039;t have a lot going for it, but it‚Äôs where Brian is from, where his family is, and where he‚Äôs chosen to return to die. Set in 1986, a year after Rock Hudson‚Äôs death brought the news of AIDS into living rooms and kitchens across America, Lambda Literary award-winning author Carter Sickels‚Äôs second novel shines light on an overlooked part of the epidemic, those men who returned to the rural communities and families who‚Äôd rejected them. Six short years after Brian Jackson moved to New York City in search of freedom and acceptance, AIDS has claimed his lover, his friends, and his future. With nothing left in New York but memories of death, Brian decides to write his mother a letter asking to come back to the place, and family, he was once so desperate to escape. The Prettiest Star is told in a chorus of voices: Brian‚Äôs mother Sharon; his fourteen-year-old sister, Jess, as she grapples with her brother‚Äôs mysterious return; and the video diaries Brian makes to document his final summer. This is an urgent story about the politics and fragility of the body, of sex and shame. Above all, Carter Sickels‚Äôs stunning novel explores the bounds of family and redemption. It is written at the far reaches of love and understanding, centering on the moments where those two forces stretch toward each other and sometimes touch.
