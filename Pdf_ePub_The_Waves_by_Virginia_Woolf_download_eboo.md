Overview
The Waves by Virginia Woolf is a modernist novel that intricately weaves together the inner lives and perceptions of six characters: Bernard, Susan, Rhoda, Neville, Jinny, and Louis. Through a series of soliloquies, these characters narrate their thoughts and experiences from childhood to adulthood, capturing the fluidity of time and the complexities of identity. The novel eschews traditional plot structure, instead focusing on the characters&#039; internal monologues and the ways their lives intersect and diverge. The prose is rich with poetic imagery and reflects Woolf&#039;s experimental approach to narrative form. Central to the novel is the character of Percival, an enigmatic figure whose presence and eventual death profoundly impact the others. The Waves explores themes of individuality, the passage of time, and the search for meaning in an ever-changing world.
